# Displays-Across-Campus
Alternative website designs that act as a hub of information for the various display spaces spread across a campus üñ•Ô∏èüßë‚Äçüè´ (2020)

Universities have a number of locations and spaces across their campus where it is possible to host exhibitions or displays. Among those are spaces in the University‚Äôs cultural units (the Museums, libraries, and theatres) but there are also a number of other spaces that can be used, including for example display areas in some of the academic schools. Just as it can be difficult for people to know what‚Äôs on display where and when, and it can be just as tricky for someone with an idea for a display to work out what spaces are available and who they should contact. Adding to the confusion, each display space has its own, different, processes for considering proposals and for making decisions about what is displayed when.

To address this problem, three alternative website designs were created for a website that allows:

1. Viewers to browse different display spaces and get information about what's on display.

2. Proposers to find out which spaces are suitable for their displays and are available, the technical information for spaces, and who to contact.

3. Space managers to get an overview of ongoing displays, pending proposals, calendars for different spaces, and available resources.

The websites were created using `Axure RP 9` as an IDE and were written in `HTML`, `CSS` and `JavaScript`. The first design is a conservative, grid-based one, the second is a curiosity-provoking, mysterious black and white one, and the third one uses the visual metaphor of a museum to provide an immersive experience.
